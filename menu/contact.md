It is usually very easy to get in touch with me and I enjoy keeping that way. 

Whether you want to contact me and talk about my projects or just say "Hi!" and ask for my phone number or Skype, the icons in the top-right corner of this page leads you to how you can directly message me.

If that doesn't work you can also concanate 'the first three letters of my last name' + 'the first two letter of my first name' + '01' + '@gmail.com' to send me an e-mail

Alternatively, you can convert the following binary number 1111101010111101101000000001 to hexadecimal + '@gmail.com'.
