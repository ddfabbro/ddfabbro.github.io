Feel free to ask anything about my projects and writings.

It is usually very easy to get in touch with me. All you have to do is use one of the icons in the top corner of this page and message me.

If that doesn't work you can also concatenate 'the first three letters of my last name' + 'the first two letter of my first name' + '01' + '@gmail.com' to send me an e-mail.

Alternatively, you can convert the following binary number 1111101010111101101000000001 to hexadecimal + '@gmail.com'.
