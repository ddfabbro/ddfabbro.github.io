I obtained the Master's Degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, <a href="http://www2.fei.edu.br/internacional/en/welcome-to-fei/" target="_blank">FEI</a>, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. During this period, I was a member of the <a href="http://fei.edu.br/~cet/ipl.html" target="_blank">Image Processing Lab</a>, where I had a full-time scholarship from <a href="http://www.capes.gov.br/" target="_blank">CAPES</a> and <a href="http://www.cnpq.br/" target="_blank">CNPq</a>/<a href="https://macc.lncc.br/" target="_blank">INCT-MACC</a> to work towards my degree as well as to collaborate with the lab on research and lectures. My research areas of interest are artificial intelligence, mathematical optimization and image processing.

Outside academia, I have worked with industrial engineering and six sigma for the oil & gas industry and I currently work with computer vision and deep learning at a fintech start-up.
