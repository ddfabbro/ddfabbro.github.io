# Contact

Feel free to ask anything about my projects and writings.

It is usually very easy to get in touch with me. All you have to do is use one of the icons in the header of this page and message me.

If that doesn't work you can also concatenate `the first three letters of my last name` + `the first two letters of my first name` + `01` + `@gmail.com` to send me an e-mail.

Alternatively, you can convert the following string of binary numbers `1111 1010 1011 1101 1010 0000 0001` to hexadecimal + `@gmail.com`.
